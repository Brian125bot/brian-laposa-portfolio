<idea>
  **Design Movement**: Cyber-Brutalist Laboratory
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Raw Data Visualization**: Treat the interface as a scientific instrument, exposing the "machinery" of the portfolio.
  2.  **High Contrast & Precision**: Emphasize clarity and exactness, mirroring analytical chemistry.
  3.  **Modular Grid Deconstruction**: Break traditional grids to reflect the breaking down of molecules and rebuilding of technology.
  4.  **Functional Aesthetics**: Every visual element must serve a purpose or represent a data point.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Base**: Deep Void Black (#050505) - representing the unknown/space.
  *   **Accent**: Neon Cyan (#00FFFF) & Acid Green (#CCFF00) - representing chemical reactions and digital signals.
  *   **Intent**: To evoke a sense of cutting-edge research and high-tech experimentation.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Asymmetric Dashboard**: A layout that resembles a complex control panel or a mass spectrometry readout.
  *   **Floating Modules**: Content sections are treated as draggable or floating windows/cards.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Monospace Typography**: Using code-like fonts for headers and data points.
  2.  **Grid Lines & Crosshairs**: Subtle background elements that suggest measurement and precision.
  3.  **Glitch Effects**: On hover, elements might briefly "glitch" to suggest digital transformation.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons and interactions should feel mechanical and responsive, like flipping a switch.
  *   **Data Reveal**: Information is revealed through user interaction, like analyzing a sample.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Staccato Transitions**: Sharp, instant changes rather than smooth fades.
  *   **Typing Effects**: Text appears as if being logged in real-time.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headers**: `JetBrains Mono` or `Space Mono` (Bold, Uppercase).
  *   **Body**: `Inter` or `Roboto` (Clean, legible) - *Wait, avoiding Inter as per instructions*. Let's use `DM Sans` for body to keep it technical but readable.

  **Design Movement**: Organic Futurism (Biotech aesthetic)
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Fluid Connectivity**: Visualizing the bridge between chemistry (organic) and technology (digital).
  2.  **Soft Tech**: Technology that feels approachable, integrated, and natural.
  3.  **Ethereal Depth**: Using layers and transparency to suggest complexity without clutter.
  4.  **Harmonious Balance**: Balancing the rigidness of code with the flow of nature.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Base**: Deep Navy/Midnight Blue (#0A192F) - depth and professionalism.
  *   **Accent**: Bioluminescent Blue (#4CC9F0) & Soft Purple (#7209B7) - representing energy and innovation.
  *   **Intent**: To create a calming yet inspiring atmosphere that suggests advanced, harmonious technology.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Fluid Scroll**: A single-page experience where sections flow into one another like liquid.
  *   **Central Spine**: A subtle central line or flow that guides the user down the page, branching out to projects.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effects for cards and overlays.
  2.  **Molecular Nodes**: Background particles that connect and react to mouse movement.
  3.  **Gradient Borders**: Soft, glowing borders that define space without harsh lines.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Smooth Flow**: All interactions should be fluid and elastic.
  *   **Magnetic Elements**: Buttons and cards gently pull towards the cursor.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Parallax Depth**: Elements move at different speeds to create a 3D sense of space.
  *   **Morphing Shapes**: Background blobs that slowly change shape and color.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headers**: `Outfit` or `Syne` (Modern, geometric but with character).
  *   **Body**: `Plus Jakarta Sans` (Friendly, modern, legible).

  **Design Movement**: Swiss International Style (Scientific Edition)
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Objective Clarity**: The content is king; the design is the frame.
  2.  **Mathematical Grids**: Rigorous adherence to a grid system, but used creatively.
  3.  **Asymmetry**: Creating tension and interest through unbalanced compositions.
  4.  **Typography as Image**: Large, bold type used as the primary visual element.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Base**: Stark White (#FFFFFF) or Very Light Grey (#F5F5F5) - clean laboratory feel.
  *   **Accent**: International Orange (#FF4F00) & Cobalt Blue (#0047AB) - high visibility and contrast.
  *   **Intent**: To communicate precision, reliability, and a modern, no-nonsense approach to innovation.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Split Screen**: Vertical division of the screen, with fixed navigation/context on one side and scrolling content on the other.
  *   **Modular Blocks**: Content is organized into clear, distinct blocks of information.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Huge Typography**: Massive headlines that act as graphical elements.
  2.  **Thick Rules**: Heavy horizontal or vertical lines separating sections.
  3.  **High-Contrast Photography**: Black and white photos with colored overlays or treatments.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Direct & Immediate**: No lag, no fluff. Instant response to clicks.
  *   **Hover Reveals**: Hovering over a project title reveals the image or details instantly.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Slide & Reveal**: Content slides in from behind masks.
  *   **Snap Scrolling**: Sections snap into place for a focused reading experience.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headers**: `Helvetica Now` (or `Arial` / `Roboto` if unavailable, but styled tightly) - Bold, tight tracking.
  *   **Body**: `IBM Plex Sans` (Humanist but technical).
